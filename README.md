# Task: Develop a simple interface screen
I'm going to be creating a new interface screen on the game Terasology.

Notes: I created a new Terasology Repo, and now I'm going to read this just to help get me started https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialNui/wiki/Quick-Start

Instead of making a new module for this task, I think they want me to use an exsiting module:https://github.com/Terasology/Sample
